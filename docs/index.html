        This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
        Calendar Year target for major releases. Versioning tags will follow a
        pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
        <br /><br />
        Version Definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major
          version. Major versions MAY include breaking or non-backwards
          compatible changes
        </li>
        <li>
          MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
          functionality or extensions of objects that are backwards compatible
        </li>
        <li>
          PATCH - minor changes that are non breaking and resolve discovered
          issues or bugs
        </li>
      </ul>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to integrate with and provided
      automated testing and validation against defined types without worry of
      instability or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the
      frequency of possibly breaking changes to prevent a large number of
      incompatible versions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting
        Verifiable Credentials related to pathogen information, such as
        chemical properties, mechanical properties, country of origin, and other
        attributes used to determine the status of a products and materials in a
        supply chain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally, this vocabulary may be looked at as a set of common objects 
        that are shared across multiple business verticals, and vertical or
        use case specific items that apply to one or more specific commodities
        or market segments. A primary goal of this specification is to 
        standardize the creation of Verifiable Credentials from standardized
        JSON-LD which is itself created from JSON Schema definitions as would
        normally be passed of REST and other APIs.  This promotes code re-use
        and establishes a pattern for the creation of JSON-LD and related
        Verifiable Credentials derived from those JSON-LD objects in a manner
        that is friendly to code and API development as well as to promote
        better interoperability between vendors who serve common or related
        markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a> section covers each vocabulary
        item, its properties, other attributes, and provides and example 
        Verifiable Credential for each item.
      </p>

      <p>
        This repository has primary contributors from four main market segments,
        and has subject matter experts from those market segments delegated
        as leads for objects related to vocabulary items for each segment.  
        <br />
        These subject matter leads help identify common elements across verticals
        as well as in assessing contributions of new objects to the vocabulary. 
        <br />

        <p>
          The following use cases outline a number of key scenarios that readers
          might find useful in a variety of sectors, especially those that deal
          with cross border supply chain data interchange.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
        privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
        environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

        into account when utilizing this data model.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
      </p>

      <p>
        This section outlines general internationalization considerations to
        take into account when utilizing this data model.
